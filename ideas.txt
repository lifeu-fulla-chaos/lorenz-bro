- 80 at a time, synchronize with the last one - 7.5 seconds / metric - measure real time
- set a common seed, choose same random state 

- set the solver for a short time - works
- use acks

-big function
    - first 80 states for synchronization, only x dot needed, send to slave, synchronize.
    - after that, for encryption we need the solution
    - function should have a flag to switch between synch and encrypt mode
    - input is initial condition and number of time steps, output in synch states is xdot for time steps, 
        in encrpyt state is solution for time steps.


- workflow
- enter synch mode..
- get master xdot
- send to slave
- synchronize
- send back ack on completion
- repeat if not synched
- enter encrypt mode
- decide on a seed
- generate 30 states
- randomly choose one state
- encrypt
- send


- slave also generates 30 states
- decrypts by randomly choosing, state remains same because of seed
- if no encryption, send ack to move on to next 30
- if encryption, send ack after encrypting



rossler takes master params
sending timesteps to synchronize
it doesnt really work
